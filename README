DBF2TSV provides two Unix command line utilities, dbf2tsv
and tsv2dbf.

dbf2tsv will convert a dBase/xBase database file with a 
maximum of 30 fields to a Tab-Separated Value (TSV) file.  
The TSV file is written on stdout.  The command line is:

   dbf2tsv dbf-filename

tsv2dbf will create a dBase/xBase file from a Tab-Separated
Value (TSV) file.  The input may have a maximum of 30
columns, with a maximum field length of 4096 bytes and a
maximum line length of 4096 bytes.  The lines in the file
must be terminated Unix-style by line-feeds.  The first line
in the file gives the tab-separated column names.  In dBase
files the maximum field name length is 12 bytes, but tsv2dbf
does not check this. The remaining lines are the tab-separated 
field values. The command line is:

   tsv2dbf tsv-filename dbf-filename

Build the utilities as follows:

   cd <source-dir> 
   make

The utilities have been tested only on a Linux Fedora 15
system, built with gcc version 4.6.0.

The source files dbf.c and dbf.h are adapted from the
shapelib library. (See http://shapelib.maptools.org)
Shapelib is a library designed for handling geographic data
in xBase format files.  The only substantive change I have
made to shapelib is to move all the code related to dBase
file handling into dbf.c and dbf.h. All the rest of the
shapelib functionality has been removed.  These two files
carry the copyright notice and permission notice from
shapelib's original author, Frank Warmerdam.  Frank's code
does all the hard stuff.

I have placed the rest of the source into the public domain,
as it is almost a trivial addition to the shapelib code
(though probably not trivial enough to be without bugs).
